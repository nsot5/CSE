# Drop the last digit from the number. The last digit is what we want to check against
# Reverse the numbers
# Multiply the digits in odd positions (1, 3, 5, etc.) by 2 and subtract 9 to all any result higher than 9
# Add all the numbers together
# The check digit (the last number of the card) is the amount that you would need to add to get a multiple of 10 (Modulo 10)
